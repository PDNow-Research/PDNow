Novel Contribution
1. No Smart Pen usage

Current paper using no Smart Pen gives results of around 67% max. Results of > 90% max only come from Smart Pen usage, which is often inaccessible to many groups. One of our main goals is to diagnose effectively for anyone, even people lacking access to a Smart Pen

Innovations
1. We tried adding more data to balance out control predictions. We added Meander data, improving predictions by large amounts. On the New Hand PD dataset, the accuracy improved from 62 to 77% (probably due to increase of data as well as increase of control data). Similar improvements on the Old Hand PD dataset, although smaller improvements (possibly because not as large an improvement due to increase of data, since there was more data in Old Hand PD dataset).



To dos:
1. Possibly reach out for these study's metrics: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291174663_Toward_Monitoring_Parkinson's_Through_Analysis_of_Static_Handwriting_Samples_A_Quantitative_Analytical_Framework
2. Look at these for creating handwriting test: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23771509/ Consider this Kappa score??

3. Explore, just used the images with CNN!!! https://opus.cloud.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/134902/1/Final_Parkinsons_NCA_Published.pdf
